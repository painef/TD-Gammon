## The GUI

Implementing the TD Gammon algorithm to play against a human.

- Use Shiny R package for interactive web apps
- Make an interactive game board that follows the rules of Backgammon 

Players

- Human
- Random Turn
- AI Agent A & B

For any given board configurations the AI Agent takes a set of pretrained weights and uses a feed forward functinon to determine which move out of it's set of possible moves gives it the highest probability of winning.

Key features of note in the GUI:

- Restricts humans to the set of legal moves on a given turn.
- Automatically sends pieces to bar.
- Tracks the possible moves left for human.
- Popup message notifies when game is over.
- Popup message notifies when there are no possible moves for AI/Random

## AI Agent A

The agent is written using three different functions. 

1. A function translates the board configuration into a feature vector
2. A feedforward function takes the feature vector and already trained weights and
